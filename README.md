# 🛡️ Social Dashboard — A Game of Thrones–Inspired UI

This project is a fully handcrafted **Social Dashboard** built using **pure HTML and CSS**, inspired by the world of *Game of Thrones*.
It reimagines what a modern social platform might look like if it existed in Westeros—combining clean UI development with thematic storytelling.

I built this project not just as a design exercise, but as a way to strengthen my fundamentals in layouting, component structure, and interface logic before moving into JavaScript frameworks.

## 📖 Overview

The dashboard is composed of multiple UI sections that work together to form a complete, interactive-looking interface—similar to the structure of modern dashboards like Twitter, GitHub, or Notion.

### **🔹 Sidebar Navigation**

A vertical sidebar built with CSS Grid + Flexbox, containing structured navigation items:

* Dashboard
* Home
* Profile
* Messages
* History
* Tasks
* Communities
* Settings, Support, Privacy

Each item uses monochrome icons styled with CSS filters for visual consistency.

### **🔹 Header Bar**

The top header contains:

* Search bar
* Notification icon
* Profile avatar
* Username

This section mirrors real dashboard headers and trains responsive alignment.

### **🔹 Latest Posts Section**

The heart of the dashboard features a grid of fictional social posts from well-known characters like Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen, Arya Stark, Cersei Lannister, and more.

Each post card includes:

* Character header
* Content text
* Action icons: ❤ Like, 🔖 Bookmark, 🔁 Share
  All styled inside a responsive CSS grid.

### **🔹 Announcements Panel**

A smaller panel displaying major “events” in the realm:

* The North on high alert
* Daenerys sailing to Westeros
* **Cersei Lannister crowned the first Queen of the Seven Kingdoms**

The design uses subtle separators, padding, and typography to create hierarchy.

### **🔹 Noble Houses Grid**

A 3×3 gallery featuring major houses of Westeros, requiring careful control of image proportions, spacing, and layout consistency.

## 🧠 Project Purpose

I built this dashboard to:

* Strengthen mastery of **CSS Grid & Flexbox**
* Practice building large, multi-section layouts without frameworks
* Improve structuring of clean and readable HTML
* Understand spacing, scaling, and card UI patterns
* Create a portfolio-ready UI component to demonstrate front-end fundamentals

This is the kind of layout commonly used in admin dashboards, analytics tools, and social platforms.

## 🧪 What I Learned

* Combining Grid and Flexbox effectively
* Designing a page with multiple functional sections
* Building visually consistent components
* Maintaining clean, semantic HTML
* Handling spacing, alignment, and card layouts
* Applying a thematic design style (GoT-inspired)

## 🏗️ Room for Improvement

This project is intentionally built with only HTML and CSS, but there are several areas I plan to expand in the future:

### **1. Add JavaScript Interactivity**

* Implement dark mode toggle
* Make sidebar collapsible
* Add “like/bookmark/share” button interactions
* Add search bar behavior
* Add modal previews for character posts
* Apply hover animations or transitions dynamically

### **2. Make the Dashboard Fully Responsive**

Planned improvements:

* Convert fixed grids into fluid, breakpoint-based layouts
* Stack sidebar into a hamburger menu on mobile
* Resize cards and images with `clamp()` and media queries
* Ensure spacing scales smoothly from desktop → tablet → mobile
* Fix overflow issues on very small screens

### **3. Add Light/Dark Theme Switching**

Once JavaScript is added, theme toggling can improve usability and aesthetics.

### **4. Refactor for Reusability**

Eventually, this dashboard can be rebuilt using:

* React + Tailwind
* Next.js with component-based architecture
* SASS modular styling
